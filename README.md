ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete in real-time, marking their choices on a 3x3 grid.

Key Features:
Interactive Gameplay: Players alternate turns to mark X's and O's on the grid.
Winner Detection: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the match ends in a draw.
Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
Simple UI: A clean and minimalistic interface for a seamless gaming experience.
This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive web applications using JavaScript for game logic and HTML/CSS for the visual structure and styling.
